I was in the bowels of the New York City subway system when the train suddenly came to a screeching hault. People were thrust forward and fell into each other, whispering their frightened apologies. “Well, well, well, looks like we have an interesting situation here,” the train driver announced before his voice crackled into unintelligable mush. “You know what he needs?” the Marquis de Lafayette volunteered, “he needs a duck.” “No,” I whispered, staring into the hopeless tunnel, “this is something deeper.”

My heart jumped into my throat as I heard screams coming from the car in front of us. “Don’t go. It’s not safe. It could be anything,” I warned. Lafayette ran for the door. A swarm of people ran into the car looking over their shoulders. “What is it?” I asked. “Bees, they’re huge!” a man yelled. “We can do this then, I said to my duck, and we ran into the next car.

The bees were the size of rodents. They were unnaturally big, larger than the marquis himself. They flew towards me to inspect me, and I tried to remain clam as well as I could. I was painfully close to the hair all over their bodies, and the long thick stinger that would probably kill me if I made a wrong move. Lafayette jumped from a handrail onto a bee in order to distract it and they were face to face. I took a chance and swung my turtle shell at the second bee, and I hit it, splattering its gooey insides against the wall. As I turned back to help my comrade, he was on the floor, with a giant bee sting in his back. The bee was dying, struggling to move its legs or flap its wings. I carefully removed the sting and we waited for the train delay to end.
